ML/DL model only input numerical data to perform training and prediction operations. So we have to convert text to numbers
Vectorization Techniques:

   1. BOW - Bag of Words
   2. TF-IDF - Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
   3. Word2Vec - Word to Vector  (Continous Bag of words and Skip Gram)
   4. GloVe - Global Vector
   5. BERT - Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
